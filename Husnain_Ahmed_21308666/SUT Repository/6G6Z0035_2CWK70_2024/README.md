# 6G6Z0035: Software Testing & Quality Assurance

## Project Overview
This repository contains the Landfill Labs Waste Management System, developed by Four Walls Software for The Council. 
It is a user-friendly program that will allow the council to be more efficient when managing and disposing of any recyclable waste from historic landfill sites.
It allows different waste management scenarios to be configured, model these scenarios accordingly, and output results that The Council can use to empty historic landfill sites.
